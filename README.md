## Goal
Easy to setup and run a mirror which copies content from some where else and provides a near exact web browsing experience in case the source server / network goes down.

## Ideas
1. All web assets should be downloaded and have with their metadata intact (content type etc.)
1. Links should be followed with some restriction to save resources.
1. Cached data should be refresh periodically.
1. A web server should be provided to serve visitor.

## Usage

### Mirror everything at `:8080`
Go to http://localhost:8080/https/github.com/ to see GitHub home page

```bash
  go-sitemirror -p 8080
```

### Mirror GitHub at `:8081`
Go to http://localhost:8081/ to see GitHub home page

```bash
  go-sitemirror -mirror https://github.com \
    -mirror-port 8081 \
    -no-cross-host \
    -whitelist github.com
```

* `-no-cross-host` to not modify assets urls from other domains
* `-whitelist` because we don't serve anything other than github.com anyway

### Docker

Do the same GitHub mirroring but with Docker.

```bash
  docker run --rm -it \
    -p 8081:8081 \
    -v "$PWD/cache:/cache" \
    xfrocks/go-sitemirror -mirror https://github.com \
    -mirror-port 8081 \
    -no-cross-host \
    -whitelist github.com
```
